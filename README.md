# NoPixel

Basically, NoPixelServer was difficult to get up and running so I'm trying to fix it and share the fixes so other people don't have to put dozens of hours in to start a server.

# Installation
1. Create a FiveM server ([guide](https://i.imgur.com/PltX24m.png))
2. Stop the server
3. Open the new folder that was created under the `txData` folder
4. Delete everything in that folder
5. Clone this repository to that folder
6. Run `nopixel.sql` in your database
7. Run `set-passwords.bat` (requires wlr - I used [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/wsl))
8. Start the server
