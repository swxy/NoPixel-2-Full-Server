# Fix Holes In The Map (Updated to After Hours DLC)

The purpose of this script is to fix the holes in the map by loading zones that aren’t loaded by default. I’ve added quite a lot of places to load, based on [Mikeeh’s script](https://forum.fivem.net/t/release-load-unloaded-ipls/5911). If you just want to fix the holes in the map, then use this resource as provided.

This resource has been completely rewritten from scratch since v2.0. You can customize almost every storymode and online purchasable interiors from your own resources.

## [Wiki](https://github.com/Bob74/bob74_ipl/wiki)
- The Wiki has been created to help you customize your interiors as you wish. It contains every function you can use for each interior.
- Each Wiki page has an example at the bottom of the page to show how you can use it in your own resource.
- Also at the bottom of the Wiki will show you the default values set by `IPL_NAME.LoadDefault()`.

## Install
1. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/Bob74/bob74_ipl/releases/latest).
2. Extract `bob74_ipl.zip` and copy the `bob74_ipl` into your `resources` folder.
3. Add `start bob74_ipl` to your your `server.cfg` file.
